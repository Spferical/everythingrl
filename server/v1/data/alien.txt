Descent into Sevastopol is a roguelike survival horror game set in the eerie and claustrophobic confines of the Sevastopol space station, ravaged by an infestation of deadly Xenomorphs. Players navigate through three treacherous levels, each presenting unique challenges and horrors. Level one, the Comms Center, features labyrinthine corridors plagued by Working Joes, malfunctioning service droids that pose a constant threat. Level two, the Transit System, is an open area where players encounter the terrifying Facehuggers, parasitic creatures that latch onto the player's face and must be quickly removed. The final level, the Reactor Core, is a dark and twisted hive filled with hordes of Xenomorphs, including Elite Xenomorphs with enhanced abilities, and the ultimate boss, the Alien Queen, a colossal and deadly matriarch.

Throughout their journey, players scavenge for valuable items such as weapons (flamethrowers, motion trackers, or stun batons), medical supplies, and keycards that unlock new areas. The level design encourages a sense of exploration and discovery, with hidden paths leading to secret caches and alternate routes. Players must carefully manage their resources and stay alert to the ever-lurking threat of the Xenomorphs, whose relentless AI and unpredictable movements keep the tension high throughout the game.
