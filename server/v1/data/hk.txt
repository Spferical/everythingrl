In the subterranean depths of the Hollow Kingdom, a roguelike adventure unfolds. The once-vibrant realm has been corrupted by the Radiance, an ancient evil that infects the land. Players embark on a perilous quest to vanquish the Radiance, armed with melee weapons and the ability to craft powerful items.

The journey spans three distinct levels, each with its unique challenges. In the Forgotten Tunnels, players face hordes of Hollow Knights, their once-noble warriors now twisted into mindless husks. The Crystal Caverns teem with ethereal creatures, including the swift Lurkers and the crystalline Sentries. Finally, the Heart of the Radiance awaits in the Abyss, an enigmatic and treacherous realm where the boundaries between reality and nightmare blur. To succeed, players must master the art of combat, combining swift attacks and powerful magic. They must also gather resources and craft weapons, armor, and charms to enhance their abilities. Only the most skilled and resourceful adventurers will prevail against the Radiance and restore balance to the Hollow Kingdom.
